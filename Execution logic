Pledge Logic:

A. Public Dataset:

1.Submit Application Form:
The maximum size of a single application form is 2PB.
The application form should contain complete information and substantial sample data.

2.Allocator Review:
The allocator reviews the application form. Upon approval, based on the customer scale, 10-50TB will be allocated for the Service Provider (SP) to perform encapsulation verification.

3.Data Verification:
The SP downloads and verifies the public dataset. If the data content and node match the application form, the customer is notified to proceed with the pledge.

4.Client Pledge:
The client pledges FIL based on the application amount. The maximum application amount is 2PB, and the client must pledge FIL corresponding to the remaining balance in a single transaction.

5.Signing and Encapsulation:
The allocator signs off, and the SP performs the encapsulation.

*Pledge Cycle:
The pledge cycle for public datasets is 20 days. The rate is 10TB = 1 FIL, and the pledge is automatically returned to the pledge address upon maturity.

6.Reapplication:
If the client has more data, they can submit a new application form (each form cannot exceed 2PB). Trusted clients can skip the review process, but any updates must be disclosed in advance.


B. Private Data:

1.Submit Application Form:
The maximum size of a single application form is 1PB.

2.Allocator Review:
The allocator reviews the application form, focusing on verifying the customer's identity and the corresponding SP information.

3.Client Pledge:
Upon approval, the allocator notifies the customer to pledge the requested amount.

4.Signing and Encapsulation:
The allocator signs off, and the SP performs the encapsulation.

*Pledge Cycle:
The pledge cycle for private data is 40 days. The rate is 10TB = 1.5 FIL, and the pledge is automatically returned to the pledge address upon maturity.

5.Reapplication:
If the client has more data, they can submit a new application form (each form cannot exceed 1PB). Trusted clients can skip the review process, but any updates must be disclosed in advance.

C.Penalty Logic

I. Automated Penalties (Automated staking token deductions through smart contracts)
	1.	When more than 50% of the encapsulated nodes have a 0% retrieval rate, 10% of the current staked tokens will be penalized.
	2.	When the average retrieval rate of the encapsulated nodes is lower than 30%, 10% of the current staked tokens will be penalized.
	3.	When data sharing occurs, 10% of the current staked tokens will be penalized.

II. Manual Penalties (Deductions through calling smart contract API interfaces)
	1.	When the Allocator administrator reviews non-compliance, they will make their own judgment and deduct the staked tokens.

III. Manual Return of Staked Tokens
	1.	When the Allocator administrator finds an incorrect deduction of staked tokens, or when the applicant successfully appeals, the staked tokens will be returned.
